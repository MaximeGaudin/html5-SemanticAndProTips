# HTML5 : Advanced semantic and techniques

For some month now, I work as a full-stack developer. Since I worked as a back-end only developer for years, I forgot some of the important semantic markup and pro-tips.

This repository documents my learning of the following resources : 

* https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML5
* https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms_in_HTML
* http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Liste_des_%C3%A9l%C3%A9ments_HTML5
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers

Even if the code is not really compilable, I added a verification pass so I will be helped during my work. To check the written code, type 

	npm install
	gulp
